            <h1>Flash Fiction</h1>
            <p>Two days before the exam, Akira wanted to review before the test started. 
                "I should start reviewing the subjects that I'm bad at", Akira said. 
                So, he goes to the library and brings out his notes. 
                Before going back to the classroom Akira borrowed some books from the library, 
                so that he can continue on studying even after class. The following day, 
                Akira decided to bring his friend Yuri to the library, so that they can both study, 
                since the exam will be held tomorrow. "Yuri wanna study together? 
                I don't want any of us to fail on this coming examination" Akira said. 
                Yuri replied "Sure, I'll just bring my pen, and notebooks". After a few hours, 
                when the class is finally over Akira told Yuri to go to school early, 
                so that they can still review before they take the exam. On the next day, 
                Yuri arrived earlier in the library before Akira. So, they started reviewing 
                mathematics. Akira is solving equations, while Yuri is playing with the variables. 
                Akira got irritated and told Yuri "Stop messing around, we don't have much time left", 
                but Yuri brushed it off with a smile on his face. 10 minutes left before the exam and 
                Akira is feeling tense, because he didn't get enough time to read, since Yuri was not getting serious. 
                Finally the long awaited time has come, they both finally take the exam and get to see their scores. 
                Akira got 32 in math, and he thought that Yuri would also get a low score since they both didn't have time
                 to review in math. "Yuri I only got 32, how about you?"Akira asked. Yuri replied with an apology 
                 "Sorry Akira, I only got 43". Akira got shock by his scores.
